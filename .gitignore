The file paths in the change list appear to be malformed or corrupted (all showing as `'"new'`), making it impossible to determine what files were actually added, deleted, or modified. Without valid file paths, I cannot analyze the changes to determine appropriate .gitignore rules.

In a real scenario, I would need properly formatted file paths to make an informed decision about what should be ignored. Based on the provided data, no valid analysis can be performed.
